My name is Zesha Goode-Rush and I'm 15 years old in Charlottesville,VA. My interestests are anime, rock music, and drawing. My favorite anime is Inuyasha and favorite rockbands are Breaking Benjamin, Trading Yesterday, RED. I like to draw anime characters, but my own characters that are mutants and/or half demons like Alex Mutant and Bryce McBride. I plan to make a animated show for my youtube channel with Alex,Bryce and three other mutants, but that may take awhile and I have to call some voice actors who voices in other cartoons or anime like Ashleigh Ball (voice of Rainbow Dash in MLP) to voice Alex and Richard Ian Cox (voice of Inuyasha eng dub) to voice Bryce.
